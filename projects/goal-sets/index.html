                            Many robotic tasks can have multiple and diverse solutions and, as such, are naturally expressed as goal sets. Examples include navigating to a room, finding a feasible placement location for an object, or opening a drawer enough to reach inside.
Using a goal set as a planning objective requires that a model for the objective be explicitly given by the user. However, some goals are intractable to model, leading to uncertainty over the goal (e.g. stable grasping of an object).
In this work, we propose a technique for planning directly to a set of sampled goal configurations. We formulate a planning as inference problem with a novel goal likelihood evaluated against the goal samples.
To handle the intractable goal likelihood, we employ generalized Bayesian inference to approximate the trajectory distribution.
The result is a fully differentiable cost which generalizes across a diverse range of goal set objectives for which samples can be obtained.
We show that by considering all goal samples throughout the planning process, our method reliably finds plans for manipulation and navigation problems where heuristic approaches fail.

                        <p>The goal set planner considers a set of goal samples as the planning objective. Our planner is better than heuristic baselines at maintaining modes of the trajectory distribution, leading to a higher likelihood that at least one feasible path to the goal region will be found.</p>

                        <p>In the examples below, the purple lines represent the trajectory distribution at each timestep. The red X's represent goal samples, and the orange contours represent the true user-defined goal distribution. Note that only the "Cross Entropy" oracle baseline has access to the true underlying distribution.</p>
